                                        WHY PROGRAMMIN ?

* In this digital era,the knowledge of coding is essential to bring innovation and change.

* To create value with your own ideas we need to know coding. 

* programming has become the basic literacy for 21st century.


                                         PROBLEM SOLVING 

* The solution to any problem involves the following 3 aspects


                                 INPUT ---->    PROCESS  ---->     OUTPUT

                                   
                                        ALGORITHM & ITS REPRESENTATION
                                          

* Process is basically a sequence of computations to be performed using thr some logic.This is known as algorithm.

* Different logic gives different algorithm.

* Process is basically a sequence of computations to be performed using some Logic. This is also known as an Algorithm. Different logic gives rise to different algorithms.

* Algorithm should be represented from the mental thoughts into a form which others can understand. There are primarily two ways of representing an algorithm:

* Flow chart: Diagrammatic way of representing the algorithm.

* Pseudo-code: Representing the algorithm between a program and normal English.

* Pseudo-code cannot be executed by a computer. It is representation of an algorithm for programmer to understand.


                                           VARIABLES & OPERATORS

* Like assignment operator, there are other operators which can be used to perform various operations.

*  Arithmetic operators: Used for performing arithmetic operations

Operators

Description

+

Addition

-

Subtraction

*

Multiplication

/

Division

%

Modulus

Relational operators: Also known as comparison operators, are used to compare values. Result of a relational expression is always either true or false.

Operators        Description

==                   Equal to

<                    Less than

>                  Greater than

<=               Less than or equal to

>=               Greater than or equal to

!=               Not equal to

* Logical operators are used to combine one or more relational expressions.

Operators            Description

AND                 Result will be true, if both the expressions are true. If any one or both the expressions are false, the result will be false

OR                    Result will be true, even if one of the expression is true. If both the expressions are false, the result will be false

NOT                 If the expression is true, result will be false and vice versa

* If A and B are two relational expressions, say A = (Num1>2000), B= (Num2>100), the result of combining A and B using logical operator is based on the result of A and B as shown below:



    A         B         A  AND B

True     True           True

True    False          False
 
False    True          False

False    False         False

 

A               B        A OR B

True      True        True
 
True      False      True

False     True       True

False     False     False

 

A           NOT A

True     False

False     True
                       
                                            DECISION CONSTRUCTS



* In a pseudo-code, typically the instructions are performed one by one or line by line. 
* But there may be situations when all the statements in a pseudo-code are not performed.
* Parts of the pseudo-code which change the flow of instructions or change the flow of control are called as control structures.


                                                          
                                            WHAT IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE ?

* Pseudo-code helped us to represent the algorithms and learn few basics of programming. But to instruct the computer we need to write a program in a programming language. There are many languages available in which we can write our programs.

*Different languages are created for different purposes. This involves trade-offs. For example a large flight can carry many passengers, but also consumes lot of fuel. Similarly different languages have different advantages.
